# Wiz.io Security Explainability UX Research

Research into Wiz.io's UI/UX patterns for presenting complex security findings in an understandable, actionable way. Focused on concrete design patterns applicable to security and observability tooling.

## 1. Platform Overview

Wiz is a cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP) that unifies multiple security domains into a single interface, built on an agentless, graph-based architecture.

**Core Product Areas:**
- **CSPM** - Cloud Security Posture Management (misconfiguration detection)
- **CWPP** - Cloud Workload Protection Platform (workload scanning)
- **CIEM** - Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (identity/access governance)
- **DSPM** - Data Security Posture Management (sensitive data discovery)
- **CDR** - Cloud Detection and Response (threat detection)
- **Vulnerability Management** - Agentless vulnerability scanning
- **AI-SPM** - AI Security Posture Management
- **Code Security** - IaC scanning and supply chain security

**Key Differentiator:** Agentless scanning + graph database architecture (Amazon Neptune) that correlates risks across all domains rather than treating them as separate point solutions.

---

## 2. Security Graph: Core Visualization Pattern

The Wiz Security Graph is the foundational UX paradigm. It is not merely a visualization layer -- it is the database, the normalizing data model, and the analysis layer combined.

### Architecture
- Built on Amazon Neptune (graph database)
- Stores hundreds of billions of relationships
- Nodes = cloud resources (VMs, containers, databases, APIs, identities, data stores)
- Edges = relationships (network access, permissions, data flows, exposure paths)
- Real-time event capture from cloud providers

### How It Communicates Security Context

**Toxic Combinations (the core explainability concept):**
- Individual risks (a misconfiguration, a vulnerability, a public exposure) displayed in isolation may appear low severity
- The graph reveals combinations where multiple low-severity risks chain together into a critical attack path
- Example: `public-facing VM` + `unpatched CVE` + `lateral movement path` + `access to sensitive database` = critical toxic combination
- This moves from "you have 10,000 vulnerabilities" to "these 12 combinations are actually exploitable"

**Graph Query Interface:**
- Custom query language (Wiz Query Language) for power users
- Path-based queries to explore relationships across data, identity, exposure, and risk
- Natural language query via "Ask AI" / Mika AI (RAG-powered text-to-graph-query engine)
- Users without graph expertise can ask questions like "Show me all internet-facing resources with access to PII"

### Design Pattern Takeaways

| Pattern | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| Relationship-first model | Show connections between entities, not just flat lists |
| Toxic combination surfacing | Correlate multiple risk signals into composite findings |
| Dual query modes | Expert query language + natural language for accessibility |
| Context-as-data-model | Store relationships in the data layer, not just the view |

---

## 3. Attack Path Visualization

Attack paths are the primary mechanism Wiz uses to explain **why** a finding matters.

### How It Works
1. Graph traversal identifies sequences of actions an attacker could take
2. Each step in the path is a concrete, verifiable relationship (not hypothetical)
3. Paths terminate at critical assets (databases with sensitive data, admin accounts)
4. Visual representation shows the exploitable pathway end-to-end

### UI Patterns
- **Linear path visualization**: Left-to-right or top-to-bottom flow showing attacker progression
- **Node annotations**: Each node in the path shows the resource type, risk factor, and its role in the chain
- **Severity escalation**: Visual indication of how risk compounds at each hop
- **Root cause highlighting**: Starting point of the attack path emphasized
- **Blast radius indication**: What gets impacted if the path is exploited

### Design Pattern Takeaways
- Attack paths answer "so what?" for every finding
- A single graph view replaces multiple disconnected alert types
- Path visualization makes non-obvious risk chains visible to non-experts
- Each node in the path is clickable for deeper investigation (progressive disclosure)

---

## 4. Risk Scoring and Issue Prioritization

Wiz explicitly moves beyond traditional CVSS-only scoring to context-aware prioritization.

### Prioritization Dimensions
- **Vulnerability severity** (CVSS as one input, not the sole factor)
- **Exploitability** (is there a known exploit? is it in KEV?)
- **Exposure** (internet-facing, publicly reachable)
- **Identity paths and permissions** (lateral movement potential)
- **Data sensitivity** (does it lead to PII, secrets, financial data?)
- **Runtime signals** (is it actually running in production?)
- **Code reachability** (is the vulnerable function actually called?)

### Two Issue Types

**Risk Issues:**
- Span multiple security domains (cross-domain toxic combinations)
- Represent immediately exploitable attack paths
- Highest urgency; require immediate response

**Posture Issues:**
- Group findings within a single domain (e.g., all vulnerabilities matching criteria)
- Not immediately exploitable but must be addressed for posture maintenance
- Driven by Posture Policies (customizable rules for grouping/promoting findings)
- Enable backlog management with SLA tracking
- Transform a noisy CVE list into a prioritized, assignable work queue

### Severity Communication
- Standard severity levels: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- But severity is contextual -- a "Medium" CVSS vulnerability in a toxic combination may surface as a "Critical" Issue
- Risk scoring communicates compound risk, not individual finding severity

### Design Pattern Takeaways

| Pattern | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| Multi-factor risk scoring | Reduces alert fatigue; surfaces real risk |
| Separate urgency tracks (Risk vs Posture) | Matches different response workflows |
| Policy-driven grouping | Consolidates hundreds of findings into actionable issues |
| SLA-aware prioritization | Ties security work to business commitments |
| Contextual severity override | CVSS 6.0 + public exposure + sensitive data = Critical |

## 5. Dashboard and Data Visualization

### Executive/Posture Dashboard
- **Compliance heatmap**: Bird's-eye view across all compliance frameworks (100+ supported: CIS, NIST, SOC2, HIPAA, HiTrust, etc.)
- Overall compliance score per framework rendered as color-coded cells
- Cross-framework heatmap shows where gaps overlap across standards
- Top-down drill-down: Framework > Categories > Controls > Resource-level assessments

### Vulnerability Dashboard
- Centralized view collecting all vulnerability data for the remediation team
- **Risk funnel**: Shows where you are in terms of each impact stage
- Key metrics: time to triage, time to patch, exploitable risk percentage resolved in production
- Breakdown by risk impact visible per vulnerability

### Non-Human Identities Dashboard
- Holistic view of service accounts, API keys, machine identities
- Prioritized queue of identity-related risks
- Surfaces risky service accounts (admin/high privileges)
- Lateral movement path detection from identity perspective

### AI Security Dashboard
- AI security posture overview
- Prioritized risk queue specific to AI/ML workloads
- Maps AI model deployments, training data, and inference endpoints

### Exposure Management Dashboard
- Single pane of glass across cloud, on-prem, code, AI, SaaS
- Centralizes findings from external scanners + native scanners
- Deduplicates and correlates findings from all sources

### Reporting
- Scheduled, role-based reports: executive vs. operator vs. auditor
- Editable templates for board-level risk communication
- On-demand dashboards for day-to-day operations
- Trend tracking: MTTR, recurrence rate, SLA adherence over time

### Design Pattern Takeaways
- Heatmaps for compliance posture (high information density, scannable)
- Funnel visualization for vulnerability lifecycle tracking
- Role-specific dashboard views (executive, operator, auditor)
- Cross-framework overlap visualization reduces duplicate effort
- Drill-down from summary to resource-level detail

## 6. Explainability Patterns

### Remediation Guidance

**AI-Powered Remediation 2.0:**
- "Choose Your Own Remediation Path" -- users select a remediation strategy, AI generates specific steps for that strategy
- Combines GenAI with Wiz Research team's attack path expertise
- Breaks down toxic combinations into concrete, actionable steps
- Generates remediation as: UI guidance, Terraform code, or CLI commands
- Links suggested changes directly in collaboration tools (Slack, Jira)

**Remediation Context Includes:**
- Why the issue matters (attack path visualization)
- What the recommended fix is (step-by-step)
- Who should own the fix (automated ownership detection)
- How to implement it (code generation for the chosen path)

### Mika AI (Natural Language Explainability)

**Capabilities:**
- Natural language queries against the Security Graph
- Explain findings in plain language
- Surface supporting evidence for any finding
- Automate policy creation from descriptions
- Text-to-query engine using RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)
- Zero-shot and few-shot learning for query generation

**UX Flow:**
1. User asks a question in natural language
2. System translates to graph query
3. Results returned with contextual explanation
4. User can drill down or ask follow-up questions

### AI Agents (Agentic Automation)

**Issues Agent:**
- Automatically evaluates most efficient remediation paths
- Surfaces issue-specific steps and recommended owners in the UI
- Can trigger pull requests to development teams
- Links context directly in Slack/Jira

**SecOps Agent:**
- Triages alerts at scale automatically
- Validates severity through graph correlation
- Produces explainable reports SOC teams can trust
- Correlates attack paths during active incidents

### MCP Server Integration
- Model Context Protocol server for external AI tool integration
- Translates natural language into Wiz-specific operations
- Enables investigation time reduction (reported: 30-45 min to ~4 min per ticket at Grammarly)
- Maintains security boundaries while enabling AI access

### Design Pattern Takeaways
- Remediation must be strategy-aware, not one-size-fits-all
- Generated code for the chosen fix reduces time-to-action
- AI explanations must show supporting evidence, not just conclusions
- Agentic automation handles triage at scale while maintaining explainability
- MCP integration enables AI-native security workflows

## 7. Information Architecture

### Unified Console Model
Wiz consolidates CSPM, CWPP, CIEM, DSPM, CDR, Vulnerability Management, Code Security, and AI-SPM into a single console. The Security Graph is the unifying data model.

### Organizational Structure

```
Platform
  |-- Wiz Cloud (posture management)
  |     |-- Security Graph (query + visualize)
  |     |-- Issues (Risk Issues + Posture Issues)
  |     |-- Compliance (frameworks + heatmaps)
  |     |-- Dashboards (vulnerability, identity, AI, etc.)
  |
  |-- Wiz Code (shift-left)
  |     |-- IaC scanning
  |     |-- Supply chain security
  |     |-- Code-to-cloud traceability
  |
  |-- Wiz Defend (detection + response)
  |     |-- Threat detection
  |     |-- Incident response
  |     |-- Runtime monitoring
  |
  |-- Exposure Management
  |     |-- Unified vulnerability management
  |     |-- Attack surface management
  |     |-- External + internal scanner aggregation
  |
  |-- Integrations
        |-- Jira, Slack, ServiceNow (ticket routing)
        |-- CI/CD pipelines
        |-- MCP Server (AI tool integration)
        |-- SIEM/SOAR platforms
```

### Navigation Philosophy
- Domain-specific dashboards accessible from unified console
- Graph is the common exploration layer across all domains
- Issues are the common action unit across all domains
- Any resource can be explored in graph context regardless of entry point

### Design Pattern Takeaways
- Single data model (graph) unifies otherwise fragmented security domains
- Two universal primitives: Graph (for exploration) and Issues (for action)
- Entry points are domain-specific, but investigation is cross-domain
- Integration layer pushes findings into existing developer workflows

## 8. Best Practices for Security/Observability Tools

Distilled from Wiz's approach, applicable to building security and observability UX.

### Making Complex Graph Relationships Understandable
- **Use attack paths as the narrative structure** -- a linear path is easier to read than a full graph
- **Surface toxic combinations, not individual nodes** -- composite findings are more actionable
- **Offer dual query modes** -- expert query language for power users, natural language for everyone else
- **Annotate nodes with their role in the risk chain** -- "entry point", "lateral movement", "target asset"
- **Make the graph explorable, not just viewable** -- click any node to see its full context

### Progressive Disclosure of Security Detail
- **Level 1: Dashboard** -- aggregate posture scores, heatmaps, top-N critical issues
- **Level 2: Issue list** -- filtered, prioritized issues with severity and status
- **Level 3: Issue detail** -- attack path, affected resources, risk factors, remediation guidance
- **Level 4: Resource detail** -- full graph context for any resource, all relationships
- **Level 5: Raw data** -- configuration details, scan results, event logs
- Each level provides enough context to decide whether to drill deeper

### Risk Communication and Prioritization Visualization
- **Multi-factor risk scoring** -- never use a single severity score (CVSS alone is insufficient)
- **Contextual severity** -- same vulnerability can be Critical or Low depending on exposure, data sensitivity, and reachability
- **Separate urgency tracks** -- immediately exploitable (Risk Issues) vs. posture maintenance (Posture Issues)
- **Funnel visualization** -- show pipeline from detection through triage to resolution
- **Heatmaps for coverage** -- quickly identify gaps across frameworks, regions, accounts
- **Trend lines** -- MTTR, recurrence rate, SLA adherence over time

### Actionable Alert Design
- **Include the "why"** -- attack path or toxic combination, not just the finding
- **Include the "who"** -- automated ownership detection and routing
- **Include the "how"** -- concrete remediation steps, ideally generated code
- **Offer remediation strategy choice** -- "patch", "isolate", "restrict access" with steps for each
- **Deduplicate aggressively** -- consolidate related findings into single actionable issues
- **Route to existing tools** -- Jira tickets, Slack messages, PR suggestions, not just a security portal

### Security Context Presentation
- **Graph-first context** -- show relationships, not just attributes
- **Blast radius visualization** -- what gets impacted if this is exploited
- **Evidence-backed explanations** -- AI-generated explanations must cite specific graph relationships
- **Role-appropriate detail** -- executive summary vs. operator detail vs. auditor evidence
- **Cross-domain correlation** -- connect code findings to cloud misconfigurations to runtime behavior

## 10. Application to observability-toolkit

The [Interface Research Index](README.md) evaluated these patterns against the toolkit's [Quality Metrics Dashboard](quality-metrics-dashboard.md) and selected **Approach E (Hybrid)** for v2.1 implementation. The following maps Wiz patterns (Section 9) to planned toolkit deliverables.

| Wiz Pattern | Toolkit Application | Target | Status |
|-------------|-------------------|--------|--------|
| Toxic Combinations | `MetricCorrelationRule` system in `computeDashboardSummary()` | v2.1 | **COMPLETE** (commit 8009f86) |
| Attack Path Visualization | `worstExplanation` drill-down + `relatedMetrics` cross-reference | v2.1 | **COMPLETE** (commits 74bbada, b90d14d) |
| Multi-factor Risk Scoring | Contextual severity overrides on `AlertThreshold` | v2.2 | Planned |
| AI-Powered Remediation | `remediationHints` on `TriggeredAlert` with metric-specific strategies | v2.1 | **COMPLETE** (commit b90d14d) |
| Progressive Disclosure | `MetricDetailResult` (L3), `EvaluationDetailResult` (L4) types | v2.2 | Planned |
| Role-based Views | `formatForRole(summary, role)` with executive/operator/auditor presets | v2.2 | Planned |
| Compliance Heatmap | Temporal heatmap grid (`MetricsHeatmap`) for metric status over time | v2.3+ | Planned |
| Risk Funnel | Pipeline stage grouping with pass rates per stage | v2.3+ | Planned |
| Evidence Trails | OTel evaluation events with `inputHash` provenance | v2.1 | **COMPLETE** (commit 3401be3) |
| SLA-aware Prioritization | `MetricSLA` on metric config with breach tracking | v2.2 | Planned |

Patterns not directly applicable to the toolkit (MCP Server, Posture Policies, Mika AI) inform design direction but do not map to specific deliverables since the toolkit operates as an MCP server consumed by LLM hosts, not as a standalone UI.
